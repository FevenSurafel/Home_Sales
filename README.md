# Home_Sales

This project uses PySpark and SparkSQL to analyze a home sales dataset. The notebook explores key metrics like average home prices based on factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and view ratings. It also demonstrates the use of caching and partitioning to optimize query performance. By using these techniques, the project provides insights into the housing market while improving data processing efficiency.
